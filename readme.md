## Rodolfo's Portfolio
[https://rodo.codes]: https://rodo.codes
Hello! Feel free to peep my code to see how the portfolio site or projects showcased were created!
I regularly visit this project on my free time to add something I'm excited to play around with or
improve something with a new pattern I've learned.

The ideas is, you can peep how I code, commit, and report issues. The codebase itself is documentation of how I work.

There is no real need to run this project yourself, but if you really want to, you can:
```
yarn install
yarn run dev
```
